Sustainability Log is a web application that helps ethical organisations create a self-verifiable, timestamped, and easily shareable digital record of their sustainability journey.

The aim is not to rate organisations but to empower them to build trust through transparency, focusing on the timeline of progress.

The application is built with React (frontend), PHP (backend), MySQL (database), and Solidity smart contract (blockchain).

It allows an organisation to enter data related to its sustainability efforts; the application logs this data to the blockchain by emitting events and provides a publicly accessible timeline of sustainability logs over time, demonstrating the organisation’s progress on its sustainability journey.

Organisations can link their suppliers into the same timeline, creating a verifiable record of their broader supply chain or market impact.

Each timeline is automatically converted into a dedicated URL and QR code, allowing it to be easily shared or displayed. In addition, an organisation can generate a unique URL and QR code for any individual product or service within its timeline, making it simple to communicate specific sustainability achievements directly to customers and partners.

The value lies in enabling organisations to demonstrate, in a verifiable and transparent way, their sustainability journey to their stakeholders - from customers and suppliers to the wider community.
